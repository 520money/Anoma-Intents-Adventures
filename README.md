🧙‍♂️ Anoma Intents Adventures

Anoma Intents Adventures is a multiplayer top-down roguelike RPG, inspired by Realm of the Mad God — but designed fully around Anoma’s Intent system.

Here, you don’t issue commands. You express intents.
Other players may join, the system coordinates, and only then the world advances.

This is not just a game. It’s a living demonstration of Anoma’s design philosophy: coordination through whispered intents.

✨ Core Features

✅ Intent System at the Core

Every action starts with an intent → propose → join → commit.

No direct commands, only coordination.

✅ All Features from 👾┃intents-games

Exploration, combat, trading, crafting, events — all Intent-driven.

Multiplayer coordination required for progression.

✅ Full Character Customization

Choose class, role, and alignment via intents.

Example:

p!intent propose class Mage
p!intent commit


✅ Multiplayer Coordination

Intent matchmaking lets players raid, trade, and explore together.

Example:

p!intent propose raid DragonLair
p!intent join raid
p!intent commit


✅ Top-Down Roguelike RPG Format

Permadeath: if you fall, you must intent to reincarnate.

Procedural dungeons explored via group intents.

Loot and resources distributed through intent-based agreements.

🧙 Anoma Philosophy in Action

In Anoma Intents Adventures, nothing happens until intents are expressed.
The world is a space of potential — only when mages whisper their will, and others align, does coordination crystallize into action.

This is the true spirit of Anoma:
👉 Intents first.
👉 Consensus before execution.
👉 Coordination as the core mechanic.
